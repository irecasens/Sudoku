    "A Sudoku puzzle is a problem where there is an incomplete 9x9 table of numbers which must be filled according to the following rules:\n",
    "- The table can be divided into 9 individual 3x3 boxes. In each of these boxes, every number (i.e. a color) between 1 to 9 must appear at least (and at most) once.\n",
